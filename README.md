# Learning Outcomes
<h3>Project Handling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : The ability to build the application from a set of high-level parts is incredibly important for me. My default is to attempt to hold all the fine details in my mind at once, operating on the low-level. This causes frustration and difficulty, making it almost impossible to move through the application code smoothly. However, building a single, atomic component, defining its interface, testing it thoroughly, and then FORGETTING about the low-level implementation allows me to free up my mind for the next challenge.</li>
  <li>Insight : This project has been quite difficult. A tendency I have noticed undermining me is that I will constantly re-imagine and evaluate for the most efficient solution. This is certainly not a bad impulse, BUT when I am building something conceptually new for the first time, just getting through it in an organized and joyful way should be the only goal. Then, once I am familiar in the domain (having built a few things, and made my share of mistakes) aiming for efficiency and finesse could be appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : Utilized CSS variables for the first time. Obviously no going back.</li>
  <li>Insight : As I hit around 200 lines of code, it became obvious why a clear code structure and logic were necessary. Despite my best attempts, the code overgrew the structure I had set for it.</li>
</ul>
